# Project: Hangman

[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/Pandenok/hangman)](http://hangman.pandenok.repl.run/)

I made this project while running through the Ruby Programming course (Intermediate Ruby: File I/O and Serialization) at The Odin Project. 

The final (for now) result can be viewed [here](http://hangman.pandenok.repl.run/). 

Hangman is a quick and easy game for at least two people. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.
